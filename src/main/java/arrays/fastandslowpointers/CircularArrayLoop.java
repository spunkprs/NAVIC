/*
*
There is a circular list of non-zero integers called nums. Each number in the list tells you how many steps to move forward or backward from your current position:

If nums[i] is positive, move nums[i] steps forward.

If nums[i] is negative, move nums[i] steps backward.

As the list is circular:

Moving forward from the last element takes you back to the first element.

Moving backward from the first element takes you to the last element.

A cycle in this list means:

You keep moving according to the numbers, and you end up repeating a sequence of indexes.

All numbers in the cycle have the same sign (either all positive or all negative).

The cycle length is greater than 1 (it involves at least two indexes).

Return true if such a cycle exists in the list or false otherwise.

Constraints:
1≤ nums.length ≤ pow(10, 3)
−5000 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 5000
nums[i] !=0
