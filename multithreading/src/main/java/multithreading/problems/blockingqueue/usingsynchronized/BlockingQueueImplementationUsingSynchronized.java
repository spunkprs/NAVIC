/*
Driver class for the simulation of Bounded Buffer problem achieved using monitor OR intrinsic lock -->

Important points to notice that are following :-
a.) Have kept size of buffer smaller than the available producer && consumer threads {though it's not imperative}
b.) Velocity of consumption i.e consumer threads is more compared to producer, hence consumer threads would be waiting individually
for the producer threads to produce something that can be consumed by the consumer threads
