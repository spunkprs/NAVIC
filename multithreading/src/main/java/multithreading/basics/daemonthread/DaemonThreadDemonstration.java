/**
This class aims to demonstrate usage of daemon thread

Brief detailing about daemon threads -->
A daemon thread runs in the background but as soon as the main application thread exits, all daemon threads are killed by the JVM

Note that in case a spawned thread isnâ€™t marked as a daemon then even if the main thread finishes execution,
JVM will wait for the spawned thread to finish before tearing down the process
