# NAVIC
Came up with this repository(NAVIC) to get all my personal work on git cloud.
Mostly till now and in the future too it will be containing DS && Alorithm material from leetcode, will be adding design related problems at LLD level and practice/usage of unexplored design patterns. 
Apart from leetcode will be exploring other places too.
In a nutshell with coming time this will be containing all my personal coding stuff.



HAPPY CODING !!
